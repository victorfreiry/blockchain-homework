Case Study Proposal: Stablecorp


What Is It

Stablecorp was founded by 3iQ, Canada’s leading crypto asset manager, and Mavennet, a recognized leader in the blockchain development space. Stablecorp is a leading Canadian fintech firm building bank-grade blockchain technology. QCAD was Stablecorp's first product release and was the first ever major Canadian-dollar stablecoin designed for the mass market. In February 2021, Stablecorp entered into a strategic partnership with VersaBank, an A-rated Canadian Schedule I bank, to develop VCAD.

3iQ was founded in 2012 by investment industry veteran, Fred Pye, and it is Canada’s first and largest multi-crypto-asset fund manager.

Mavennet is a venture studio and consulting organization with deep expertise in blockchain and AI technologies. Mavennet has more than 4 years of history working in the financial industry as well as the physical economy & commodities with clients such as Canadian banks, TMX, the Canadian government and US Homeland Security. Why This Matters In traditional financial markets, new companies or start-ups usually go through private venture capital channels to raise capital, while more established companies may instead undergo an initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital from investors via the public markets. In contrast, TokenFunder's vision of creating a digital securities marketplace allows both retail investors and institutional investors alike to invest in start-up companies via digital tokens that can also be traded amongst other investors. Therefore, TokenFunder's vision will help to increase start up companies' ability to raise capital from the everyday investor as well as bolster investors' ability to invest in new companies that they may not have been able to before.

This could be very interesting in case canadians want to start using DEFI with a CAD stable coins, there is a significant higher yield available in Defi for stable coins and this could be just the beggining for Canadians to become more and more bankless.
